# DVG001 (Spring 25) - [Introduction to Linux and small networks](https://www.hig.se/engelska/university-of-gavle/study/programmes-and-courses/course-page?identifier=DVG001) @ [HiG](https://www.hig.se/engelska/university-of-gavle)
In short, this course consits of six labs, one project assignment and lastly an exam. All assignments touches upon networking and linux for absolute beginners. From installing Debain linux to setting up a web server over IPv6 along with firewall rules using UFW.

## Structure
The repo contains all my lab reports and my project assignment as readable PDFs along with any relevant scripts or files reffered to from the PDFs. For the very simple landing page developed for the web server project I refer you to the [other repository](https://github.com/Snicon/DVG001_Introduction-to-Linux-and-small-networks_landing-page).
